## 🧩 Who Am I?

designing APIs, handling databases, and writing clean, scalable server-side logic.

I care more about **performance, structure, and reliability** than UI animations.

## ⚙️ What I Like Working On

- Authentication & Authorization  
- Database schema design  
- Server-side logic & optimization  
- Debugging and problem-solving

## 🧠 Mindset
